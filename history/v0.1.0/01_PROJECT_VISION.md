# Project Vision: CS-Space

## Mission Statement

CS-Space is an interactive learning environment that transforms the vast, abstract landscape of computer science into a personalized, explorable knowledge graph. It moves beyond static roadmaps by providing an active workspace where users can discover learning paths, engage with educational content, and validate their skills in a single, seamless experience.

## Core Philosophy

The journey of a self-taught developer is often hampered by two questions: "What should I learn next?" and "Do I truly understand this?" CS-Space is designed to answer both. It rejects passive information consumption in favor of active, user-driven discovery and tangible proof of mastery. Our core belief is that learning is most effective when it is visual, interactive, and provides a tight feedback loop between discovery, education, and validation.

## The User Experience & Key Functionality

The end goal is a fluid and intuitive platform that feels like a personal GPS for a user's technical career.

### 1. The Knowledge Graph: Your Personal Universe

*   **UI/UX:** The central view of the application is an infinite canvas where the user's knowledge is visualized as a "universe." Broad domains like "Web Development" or "Data Science" appear as **Galaxies**. Within these galaxies are **Constellations** of specific technologies or concepts (e.g., "React," "Python," "SQL"). The user can pan, zoom, and explore this space, which is a living, breathing representation of their unique learning journey. The interface is clean and minimal, designed to feel less like a rigid chart and more like a creative mind-mapping tool.

### 2. AI-Powered Discovery: Expanding Your Horizons

*   **Functionality:** The graph is not static; it grows with the user. A user can right-click any node (e.g., "Python Functions") and trigger an **AI-powered expansion**. This action intelligently queries the backend to discover and display related nodes, such as prerequisites ("Python Basics"), next steps ("Python Decorators"), and alternatives. The graph animates in real-time as new nodes and their connections are added, providing a magical and rewarding sense of discovery.

### 3. The Learning Loop: From Discovery to Understanding

*   **UI/UX:** Clicking a "Learn" button on any node seamlessly transitions the user into a focused **Learning Module**. This is an integrated chat interface, pre-configured with a system prompt tailored to Socratic learning for that specific topic. This eliminates context switching and keeps the user in a state of flow. The experience is designed to be self-contained, allowing a user to go from discovering a concept to deeply understanding it without ever leaving the platform.

### 4. Mastery Validation: Proving Your Knowledge

*   **Functionality:** Once a user feels confident, they can initiate a **"Prove It" challenge**. The system uses an AI call to generate a short, relevant challenge (starting with multiple-choice quizzes for the MVP) to test their understanding.
*   **UI/UX:** Upon successful completion, the node on the graph visually changes. It might gain a golden border, a checkmark, or change color, providing clear and motivating feedback. This gamified loop of learning and validation transforms the graph from a simple map into a record of proven accomplishments. Other UI/UX is TBD.
